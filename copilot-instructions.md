This is a HTML and JS project. The goal is to create a simple web application that allows users to input data and visualize it using Plotly charts. The application will also include an AI chat assistant that can provide insights based on the data. The main goal is to help users understand how the data variables are related to each other, and eventually get health insights from the AI assistant.

## Code Standards
- When you write code, keep it simple stupid (KISS).

## Repository Structure
- Design instructions will go in design/PROJECT.md
- We will configure the rest of the repository later. For now, focus on the core functionality and keep the structure simple.
